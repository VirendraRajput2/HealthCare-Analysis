This project focuses on analyzing healthcare data to understand patterns in teleconsultation usage, healthcare access, disease distribution, and patient satisfaction. It integrates data manipulation, cleaning, and visualization using Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Python. The aim is to assist healthcare planners and decision-makers in identifying service gaps and optimizing healthcare delivery, especially in rural areas.

üîß Tools Used
Excel ‚Äì For initial data exploration and manual validation

SQL ‚Äì For querying, filtering, and transforming datasets

Power BI ‚Äì For interactive visualization and dashboard creation

Python (Pandas) ‚Äì For removing duplicate values and additional data cleaning
